# PDF-Password-Protector

PDF Password Protector
The PDF Password Protector is a Python application that allows you to encrypt PDF files with a password to secure their contents.

Installation
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.
Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install PyPDF2

Usage
Place the PDF file(s) you want to encrypt in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the file(s).
Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script with the following command:
Copy code
python script_name.py
Replace script_name.py with the name of your Python script.
Follow the prompts to enter the password for encryption.
Once the encryption process is complete, a new encrypted PDF file will be created in the same directory as the original file(s).
Important Notes
Make sure to remember the password you set for encryption. Without it, you won't be able to open the encrypted PDF file.
The encryption level is set to 128-bit by default, providing strong security for your PDF files. You can modify this level as per your requirements.
This application uses the PyPDF2 library for PDF manipulation and encryption.
